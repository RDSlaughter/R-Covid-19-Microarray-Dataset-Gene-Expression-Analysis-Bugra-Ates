## Buğra ATEŞ 17.01.2021

In this R project I applied some statistical methods to analize covid-19 microarray dataset. 
I explained all the steps and code lines in .Rmd file. I made it markdown file , so you can see the each processes.
## Required R packages: 
### [limma](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html)
### [dplyr](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8)
### [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html)
